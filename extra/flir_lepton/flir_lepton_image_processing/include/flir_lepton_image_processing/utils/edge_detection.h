      /**
        @brief Takes an input image of edges of CV_8U depth
        and tries to isolate specific shapes so as to facilitate
        the blob detection process.

        The execution flow is as follows: first, all pixels connected
        directly or indirectly to the image's borders are eliminated,
        leaving behind all standalone shapes and curves.
        Next, all open-ended curves are contidionally closed.
        The reason behind this is that the open-ended curves might be
        edges of thermal rois that have either been smudged by the appliance of
        a threshold after the production of edges, or that have in the first
        place not been detected due to low contrast in a roi's borders.
        After the connection of the end-points of open-ended shapes,
        pruning is applied to get rid of all minor open-ended curves not
        closed by the connection process. The result here is a binary image
        featuring only closed shapes, but whose insides may be cluttered with
        non-zero value pixels, since the edges of what may be inside a roi
        are still detected and present in the current product image.
        What we want, based on this image, is to find only the external
        limits of each closed curve, because these pixels will be the
        outline of each blob. A method is then invoked to do just so.
        The end product of this method is a binary image with closed curves.
        Everything inside each closed curve is black and everything outside
        all closed curves is void.
